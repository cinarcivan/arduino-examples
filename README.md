<h1 align="center">Arduino Guide and Examples</h1>

This repo aims to be a helpful guide for people who are new to working with Arduino and those who want to improve themselves. By taking advantage of this repo, which contains sample codes, explanations and applied basic codes, you can better understand working with Arduino and start developing your own projects.
<br><br>
To better understand working with Arduino, we recommend that you start with the "guide" folder first. You can better understand how you should follow the contents in the guide by reading the "README.md" file in this folder.
<br><br>
Afterwards, you can better understand what you have learned by reading the sample codes in the "basics" folder and trying it with your own Arduino.
